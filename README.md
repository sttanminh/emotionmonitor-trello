## To set up local developing environment

Install docker https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

Add a .env file in the root directory
```env
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://admin:secret@localhost:27017/dev_insights?authSource=admin&directConnection=true"
```
Run
```bash
npm install
make makefile all
```
Make changes in prisma/schema.prisma as needed. For prisma client to recognise the changes and preserve them, run
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```
## Getting started
Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
